# Old Reddit Destyler

## About

Old Reddit Destyler is a browser extension designed to improve the Reddit
experience by addressing issues with custom CSS in many subreddits. The idea for
this extension came from frustration with how some subreddits misuse CSS, making
them visually distracting and difficult to use.

The goal of Old Reddit Destyler is simple: to make Reddit more user-friendly by
fixing the problems caused by excessive CSS. By removing clutter and improving
readability, the extension aims to create a more enjoyable browsing experience
for everyone.
